  * animation frames.
  * 
  * The method allows you to execute code on the next available screen repaint 
  * and resulting in a smoother, more efficient animation.
  * 
  * @note Furthermore, callback running via this method will be either paused or 
  * slowed down significantly when browser running in background (since there is 
  * no point to render animation when it is invisible).
  *

  * @readonly The reason using a wrapper anonymous here beacuse when importing 
  * this file as below:
  * ```js
  * import * as animation from "src/base/common/animation";
  * animation.requestAnimationFrame( () => {} );
  * ```
  * An error will be thrown since requestAnimationFrame must be excuted via the 
  * context of `window`. To fix this, a wrapper function will fix this properly
  * by using `.call()`.
